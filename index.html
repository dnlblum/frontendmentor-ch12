            <p class="testemonial">"I was an EMT for manu years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some ppeple who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've sucesfully switched carrers, working as aSoftware Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <p class="testemonial test-onwhite"">"Beforjoining the bootcamp, I've never wrtten a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals whocan help melearn programming step by step. I was encouraged to anroll by a former student of theirs who cann  only say wonderful thingsabout the program. The entire curriculum and the staff did not disappont. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutotialcould ever have. In fact, I've oten referred to it during interviews as an example of my development exorience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offer. 100% reccomend!"</p>
